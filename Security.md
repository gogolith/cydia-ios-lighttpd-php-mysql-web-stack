Keep in mind: Your iOS device is jailbreakable because there are a lot of security holes inside your very new iOS software.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you are go now online with a jailbroken iOS device and you are using (sometimes very) old system tools from the main Cydia repo then your device is vulnerable and it could be possible that everyone inside your (local) network is be able to hack your device very easy.<br>
<br>
<br>
Remember, hacker and a lot of governments (US, China, Australia, Germany, etc.) are be lucky to have a look inside of your jailbroken iOS device.<br>
<br>
<br>
That is the reason why I'm try to update some necessary security tools to the newest version. Not all but some!<br>
<br>
<br>
It is up to you to use my newest security packages or the (very) old security packages from the main Cydia repo.<br>
